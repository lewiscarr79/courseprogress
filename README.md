<h1>About</h1>
A Simple Course Progress Report for Moodle.  This plugin was built to provide a simple progress report for courses.  The activity completion report is my favourite, but it results in horizontal scrolling and doesn't give a quick percentage for each user.
So I wrote this.

<h1>Feature</h1>
Lists the full name, course percentage as a graph and a number, course start date and course end date.
The columns are sortable by ascending and descending order.
The report can be exported as a CSV, Excel and a PDF
The colours of the percentage bar change depending on how far the user is through the course (just thought it would be a nice visual)
The dates are in readable UK English (sorry to our US counterparts, but it's annoying for us also!)

<h2>Installation</h2>
Copy the folder to report/ in your Moodle installation
Or install via Git
Or install via Moodle directly as an uploaded plugin

<h2>License</h2>
All GPL as it's Moodle

<h2>Disclaimer and Warranty</h2>
None, I'm afraid. It's sold as seen and used at your risk.
